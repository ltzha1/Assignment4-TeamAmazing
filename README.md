# Assignment4-Team-Amazing

Groups for the assignment:

- You will be working with the same group as you did in Assignment 3
- This is a group assignment and failure to engage with the team will severely affect the individual grade.
- Please see Monash guide to work in teams https://www.monash.edu/rlo/study-skills/learning-at-university/working-in-groups-and-teams

# Assignment Goals:

- Demonstrate that you are capable of creating a collaborative and  reproducible pdf or html report using RStudio, Git and GitHub.
- Demonstrate that you are capable of using all the tools that we have learned during the semester.
- Demonstrate that you are able to use effectively and successfully Git, GitHub and Rstudio.
- For this task, you can use an existing template or you can create a new template if you wish.
- Please make sure that you do not include R messages or warnings in the report output. However, you may choose to output code parts if those are relevant for the report output.

# Tasks

Work in your designated groups (same groups as for ETC5513 Assignment 3) to create a reproducible and collaborative report. For this report your team will need to:

- Select a research question or questions to be investigated in the report.
- Find the relevant data to answer your research question/s.
- Within your groups get organised to create a reproducible report. The entire history of the report must be stored in GitHub (that includes all the commits). Working in another repo and transfer things in the assignment report is not valid. You must work in the same GitHub repo for the entire duration of the project.
- Organise the tasks among the team members so that you can work on individual branches. Each team member can create more than one branch if needed.
- Merge all the branches to the master branch to create a final report.
- Include a .gitignore file so that you only track the relevant files to reproduce the project.
- Include a license in the repo.
- The README.md file should have all the information needed to ensure reproducibility and should have a little summary of what the project is about.
- Each section of the report should have no more than 300-400 words.
- During the preparation your Github repo can be private. However, at the time of the submission the repo will need to be public and cannot not be modified after the submission deadline.
- **Remember, this is a collaborative effort. Please work as a collaborative and inclusive team (using issues in GitHub might help you with that too). Listen and give voice to all the members of the team and have fun with the exercise!**


# Project Summary and Data set

This project is going to analysis how well Australia is handling the Covid-19 in four sections, including total cases confirmed, recovery status, transmission sources and vaccination rate.

The data set for this project was obtained from the COVID-19 in Australia and contains the following variables:

- Date
- State and territory: NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, TAS, NT & ACT
- Status of recovery
- Transmission sources of cases
- Total vaccine doses delivered

# Due Date

- **Assignment is due on Friday June 4 at 5:00pm. Late submissions will not be accepted.**
- By the due date, all the changes in your repo need to be merged to the master branch and the final report must be in the last commit of the master branch.
- If GitHub repos are modified after the submission date. The assignment will be marked with a 0.
- GitHub repos will need to contain all the files to reproduce the report that will also include the data (if the report cannot be reproduced from the files in the GitHub repo) the report will be considered non-reproducible and will be marked with a 0.
- **In week 12 all the teams will present their projects to the rest of the tutorial classmates during the tutorial hours (assistance is mandatory). Each team will have approximately 15 minutes to present their project and all the team members must participate in the presentation. The teaching team will ask questions after each presentation. The presentation teams order will be random and made available next week.**

# Assignment Submission

Each of you will need to submit the assignment in Moodle as follows:

1. In Moodle: paste the http of your GitHub repo (submissions that do not contain this information will be considered non-reproducible). Ensure that all your paths are relative to the project folder. Also make sure the repo is public.
2. Add the name of your group.
3. Add the name of the section/s that you worked on.
4. Upload the Rmd file of the project.
5. If your report is in html format, upload the html file, save the report into a pdf file using Google chrome and upload the pdf too. Both html and pdf!
6. Upload the pdf file of the project if your report is rendered into pdf.
7. After the assignment is submitted you will need to grade your team members confidentially via Moodle. Instructions for that will follow.
8. Important:
  - Your GitHub repo including all the history will also be marked.
  - Do not worry if you encountered problems during the commits, branching or merging. The important thing is that all the conflicts are resolved and you have your final report in the last commit of your master branch. That will show that you are able to use the tools!
  - All the files used to create the report need to be included in the GitHub repository. If the report cannot be reproduced from the clone repository, the assignment will be considered non-reproducible and will be marked with a 0.
  - Make sure you do not use absolute paths to read data. That will make your report non-reproducible.

***Please read these instructions carefully so that you donâ€™t miss anything in the submission.***
